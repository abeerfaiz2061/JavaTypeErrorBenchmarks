# Collecting Benchmarks for Type Incorrect Java Programs
This repository contains the codebase for my dissertation titled "**Collecting Benchmarks for Type Incorrect Java Programs**." The goal of this project is to collect benchmarks for Java programs that contain compile-time type errors and evaluate how different Java compilers handle these errors. The three compilers used in this study are:

* Oracle's javac Compiler
* Eclipse's ecj Compiler
* JastAdd's ExtendJ Compiler
